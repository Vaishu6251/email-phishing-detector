🧠 Overview
This project detects whether an email message is phishing or legitimate (safe) using machine learning and NLP.
The model analyzes the message content and classifies it as “Phishing” or “Safe.”

🚀 Features
Detects phishing emails based only on message text.
Uses NLP and trained ML model for accurate classification.
Simple and user-friendly code structure.
Can be integrated with any email system or app.


⚙️ How It Works

Paste the email message content into the program.
The message is converted into numerical features using the vectorizer.
The ML model checks and predicts if the message is phishing or safe.
The program prints the result directly in the terminal.
